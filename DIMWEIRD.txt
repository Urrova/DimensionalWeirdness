Description             : You just infiltrated an enemy base to find out
                          where so many demons came from, and you discover a
                          portal. You decided to enter the portal and it took
                          you to a surprising place: Another dimension, where
                          demons are produced to fight allies with enemies.
                          Can you defeat the one who controls the dimension
                          and then destroy the dimension?
                          
                          This wad is a non-terry version of SIGTAGNY.wad,
                          which originally had terry traps, screamers and
                          shit. I grabbed it and made my own version of
                          SIGTAGNY.wad, which is this pk3.
