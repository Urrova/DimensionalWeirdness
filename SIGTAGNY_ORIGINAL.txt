Description             : After hell's invasion of Earth, the UAC set up
                          giant floating cities while the remaining
                          population re-built human society on Earth.
                          
                          While patroling the Earth's surface, shooting the
                          remaining imps and zombies, you get a radio
                          transmission from one of the floating cities. You
                          run to your pilot and fly there.
                          
                          But what you didn't know, is that the secrets go
                          far beyond hell this time.
