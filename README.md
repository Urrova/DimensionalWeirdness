# Dimensional Weirdness

You just infiltrated an enemy base to find out where so many demons came from, and you discover a portal. You decided to enter the portal and it took you to a surprising place: Another dimension, where demons are produced to fight allies with enemies. Can you defeat the one who controls the dimension and then destroy the dimension?
                          
This wad is a non-terry version of **SIGTAGNY.wad** , which originally had terry traps, screamers and shit. I grabbed it and made my own version of SIGTAGNY.wad, which is this pk3.

# How to play the .pk3
This mod is for GZDoom, a heavily modified doom engine. You can download it from [here](https://zdoom.org/downloads)
Also you need the original DOOM2.WAD file. If you bought it throught steam GZDoom autodetects it.
If not, you have to put DOOM2.WAD to the root folder of GZDoom
